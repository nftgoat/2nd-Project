# 2nd-Project
## What I Did
I am made a digital portfolio. In this project I coded the entire HTML and CSS pages from scratch. I made the layout of the page match up to a Mock-Up that was presented in my instructions. I linked my navigation bar tags tho their corresponding sections of the webpage, and I made my webpage unclude some information about me and all neccesary information to contact me.
## Why I used placeholder images
I used placeholder images in place for where my resume and work will be going. I did this because I have not yet created any projects that I think are valued enough to put into my portfolio, and my instuctor advised it was okay to use them.
## What I gained from this project
Completing this project made me feel much more confident in my HTML and CSS skills. I am happy with how closely I was able to get my webpage to look in relation to the Mockup.
